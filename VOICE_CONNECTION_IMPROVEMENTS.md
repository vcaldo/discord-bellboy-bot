# Voice Connection Improvements

## Problem Description
The Discord bot was experiencing WebSocket connection errors with code 4006 ("Session no longer valid") when trying to connect to Discord's voice channels. This was causing the bot to fail joining voice channels and repeatedly retry connections.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing retry logic**: No exponential backoff strategy for failed voice connections
2. **No timeout handling**: Voice connection attempts could hang indefinitely
3. **Race conditions**: Multiple voice operations could interfere with each other
4. **Stale connection state**: Old voice connections weren't properly cleaned up
5. **No specific error handling**: WebSocket errors weren't handled gracefully

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Voice Connection Methods
- **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) for connection attempts
- **Timeouts**: All voice operations now have configurable timeouts (default 30s)
- **Connection Verification**: Verify connections are actually successful after establishing
- **Stale Connection Cleanup**: Automatically clean up broken connections before retrying

### 2. Race Condition Prevention
- **Per-guild Locks**: Added asyncio locks to prevent concurrent voice operations on the same guild
- **State Verification**: Check connection state before attempting operations

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- **Specific Error Handling**: Handle WebSocket close code 4006 specifically
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation even if voice connections fail
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better error messages and debugging information

### 4. Health Monitoring
- **Connection Health Monitor**: Background task that checks and cleans up stale connections every minute
- **Error Metrics**: Track connection errors for monitoring

### 5. Configurable Parameters
New environment variables for fine-tuning:
- `VOICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- `VOICE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`: Number of retry attempts (default: 3)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
environment:
  - VOICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=${VOICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT:-30}
  - VOICE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=${VOICE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS:-3}
  - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
  - PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
```

### .env File Example
```bash
# Voice connection settings
VOICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30
VOICE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# Existing settings...
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Key Improvements

### Before
- Direct connection attempts with no retry
- No timeout handling
- No cleanup of failed connections
- Race conditions possible
- Generic error handling

### After
- Exponential backoff retry strategy
- Configurable timeouts for all operations
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Per-guild operation locks
- Specific WebSocket error handling
- Health monitoring background task

## Expected Behavior

1. **Connection Failures**: Bot will retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
2. **WebSocket 4006 Errors**: Automatically clean up and retry on next voice activity
3. **Timeout Protection**: Operations won't hang indefinitely
4. **Stale Connections**: Automatically detected and cleaned up
5. **Better Logging**: More detailed information about connection attempts and failures

## Monitoring

The bot now provides better metrics for monitoring voice connection health:
- Connection success/failure rates
- Retry attempt frequency
- Timeout occurrences
- WebSocket error codes

## Deployment

1. Update the docker-compose.yml with new environment variables
2. Restart the bot container
3. Monitor logs for improved error handling and retry behavior

## Testing

After deployment, test by:
1. Having users join/leave voice channels rapidly
2. Simulating network interruptions
3. Monitoring bot behavior during Discord outages
4. Checking that the bot properly reconnects after connection issues

The bot should now handle voice connection issues much more gracefully and recover automatically from temporary Discord API issues.
