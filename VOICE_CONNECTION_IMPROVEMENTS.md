# Voice Connection Reliability Improvements

## Issue Analysis
Based on the logs, the bot was experiencing Discord error code 4006 ("Session no longer valid") when attempting to connect to voice channels immediately after startup. This is a common issue with Discord voice connections that can be resolved with better connection management.

## Improvements Made

### üõ°Ô∏è **Connection Management**
- **Startup Delay**: 10-second delay after bot startup before attempting voice connections
- **Connection Cooldowns**: 30-second cooldown between connection attempts per guild
- **Connection State Tracking**: Tracks last connection attempt times per guild

### üîÑ **Retry Logic**
- **Safe Connection Method**: `safe_connect_to_channel()` with built-in retry logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: For Discord error 4006 specifically
- **Connection Timeout**: 10-second timeout per connection attempt
- **Maximum Retries**: 3 attempts before giving up

### üß† **Smart Decision Making**
- **Cooldown-Aware Decisions**: `should_bot_join()` respects connection cooldowns
- **Startup Connection Logic**: Separate logic for startup vs. runtime connections
- **Connection State Validation**: Checks if already connected before attempting

## Key Methods Added

### `PresenceManager.set_bot_ready_time()`
```python
# Call in on_ready() to mark when bot became ready
self.presence_manager.set_bot_ready_time()
```

### `PresenceManager.safe_connect_to_channel()`
```python
# Safely connect with retry logic and error handling
success = await self.presence_manager.safe_connect_to_channel(channel, guild)
```

### `PresenceManager.should_attempt_startup_connection()`
```python
# Check if startup connection should be attempted (respects delays and cooldowns)
if self.presence_manager.should_attempt_startup_connection(guild):
    # Attempt connection
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (optional)
```properties
# Connection management can be tuned via these class attributes:
# connection_cooldown = 30.0    # Seconds between attempts per guild
# startup_delay = 10.0          # Delay after bot startup
# max_retries = 3               # Maximum connection attempts
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ **Reduced Connection Errors**
- Startup delay prevents session conflicts
- Cooldowns prevent rapid retry attempts
- Retry logic handles temporary Discord issues

### ‚úÖ **Better Error Handling**
- Specific handling for Discord error 4006
- Exponential backoff for session errors
- Graceful fallback on connection failures

### ‚úÖ **Improved Reliability**
- Connection attempts are tracked and managed
- No more immediate connection attempts after startup
- Respect Discord's connection limitations

### ‚úÖ **Maintained Functionality**
- All existing features work as before
- Backward compatibility preserved
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

## Usage in Bot Code

### Before (Direct Connection)
```python
await channel.connect()  # Could fail with 4006 error
```

### After (Safe Connection)
```python
success = await self.presence_manager.safe_connect_to_channel(channel, guild)
if success:
    self.logger.info("Connected successfully")
```

## Expected Behavior

With these improvements, the bot should:

1. **Wait 10 seconds** after startup before attempting any voice connections
2. **Respect cooldowns** between connection attempts per guild
3. **Retry failed connections** with exponential backoff for error 4006
4. **Log connection attempts** clearly for troubleshooting
5. **Handle connection failures gracefully** without crashing

The Discord error 4006 should be significantly reduced or eliminated with these improvements, especially the startup delay and retry logic.
